# What is your phone? WWDC 2020 (Accepted)
Hello!👋 Nowadays, the telephone has become a necessary part of our lives. With it, we can store memories 🏝, 
communicate with loved ones 👪, create content 🎨, work 💼 and much more. 

Often the phone📱 becomes our friend and knows us well. But today we ask the question: what do we know about 
him? 🤷‍♂️ We know its functions well, we know about photos in the gallery and installed applications. We even 
know about the details of which it consists. But not all of us can say what makes these details work ⚙️.

Did you know that your phone has about 300 milligrams of silver and 30 milligrams of gold?🙀 In addition, 
it contains many other rare elements.
 
My game will help you better know your "friend" and answer the question - What does it consist of?
